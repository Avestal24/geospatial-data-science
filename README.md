# Geospatial Data Science Applications 

Course materials for Geospatial Date Science Applications (GEOG 4/590) taught at the Department of Geography, University of Oregon

## Overview

This course introduces students to emerging geospatial data science methods for addressing important environmental challenges in the western USA. The course will be taught as a series of short lectures and longer computer labs in which students will learn how to use Python to process (e.g. resampling, manipulating, interpolating), analyze (e.g. machine learning), and visualize (e.g. plotting, mapping) geospatial data. Students will apply these newly developed skills to real world applications (e.g. water management, renewable energy, agriculture, hazards, and climate change). In doing so,
students will become familiar with a variety of data sources including those derived from satellite remote sensing, climate models, weather stations, census bureau, crowdsourced maps, and GPS. The course will be best suited for students who already have some programming (e.g. CIS 122) and GIS (e.g. 481) experience. The skills developed during this course will be directly applicable to a career in (geospatial) data science.

Learning outcomes:

* something 
* something else

## Schedule

The course will be taught over ten weeks, with a lecture on Monday and lab on Friday. The lectures will be interactive, often providing a recap of the previous lab. The labs will introduce key concepts of geospatial data analysis using code examples.

## Final project

An essential component of this course is the final project which provides an opportunity to explore a particular topic of interest using some of the skills developed in this course. Students can work independently or in groups of two or three. A short summary of a project idea is expected by Week 4. There will be a project check-in during the lab in Week 6 and 8, and the final project write-up and presentation will be due in Week 10.
